I am a final-year Ph.D student in Computer Graphics Group at Yale University  advised by 
[Prof. Holly Rushmeier](https://graphics.cs.yale.edu/people/holly-rushmeier) and [Prof. Julie Dorsey](https://graphics.cs.yale.edu/people/julie-dorsey). 
My current research focuses on material appearance modeling and rendering. Prior to Yale, I received my bachelorâ€™s degree in the Computer Science Department at Zhejiang University.

I interned at Adobe Research, London Lab working with [Valentin Deschaintre](https://valentin.deschaintre.fr/), 
and also at Meta (Facebook) Reality Lab with [Chakravarty R. Alla Chaitanya](https://dblp.org/pid/204/0028.html). During my undergraduate study, I was a research assistant advised by [Prof. Rui Wang](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/rwang/) working on GPU pipeline optimization.

Besides graphics, I was a visiting research scholar at Harvard Medical School supervised by [Prof. Quanzheng Li](https://gordon.mgh.harvard.edu/gc/people/faculty/quanzheng-li/), working on medical image processing.
