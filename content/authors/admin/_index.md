I am a research scientist at Adobe Research. I received my Ph.D. from Yale University, under the supervision by [Prof. Holly Rushmeier](https://graphics.cs.yale.edu/people/holly-rushmeier) and [Prof. Julie Dorsey](https://graphics.cs.yale.edu/people/julie-dorsey). Prior to Yale, I received my bachelorâ€™s degree from Zhejiang University, advised by [Prof. Rui Wang](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/rwang/). 

My research focuses on 2D and 3D graphics, with a special interest in generative AI for content creation at Adobe. We shipped multiple GenAI 2D/3D workflows in [Substance 3D Viewer](https://helpx.adobe.com/substance-3d-viewer.html), [Substance 3D Stager](https://www.adobe.com/products/substance3d/apps/stager.html) and [Substance 3D API as Firefly Service](https://developer.adobe.com/firefly-services/docs/s3dapi/guides/generate_3d_object_composite/) involving generative asset creation and composition etc. I am exploring more interesting multi-modality content creation methods, models and workflows. I am open to collaborations and welcome strong Ph.D. students interested in research internships at Adobe Research.
